##Codebook for data.csv

The data in data.csv represent data collected for the empirical experiment performed by Julie K. Curtis and Maridee S. Carson entitled "Facebook Use and Mood" which was performed as their capstone project at Eastern Oregon University. Participants accessed an online link hosted by SurveyGizmo. When the entire experiment was finished, data was exported from that site into an Excel spreadsheet. Within the spreadsheet, the text strings were converted into numerical values and PANAS scores were calculated. The data was then exported from Excel into a .csv file that is suitable for analysis. 
The data file includes 7 variables.

¥  ID: The number that was assigned to the participant by SurveyGizmo when the participant accessed the site.

¥	PANAS: The PANAS test score for the participant. The PANAS items assessing negative affect (n=10) were reverse-scored and combined with the positive affect items into a single score, with higher values indicating more positive mood. 

¥	Group: The condition to which the participants were assigned. The condition determined whether the participant would 1) use Facebook for 20 minutes and then take the PANAS and answer questions; 2) browse online for 20 minutes and then take the PANAS and answer questions; or 3) go directly to the PANAS test and answer questions in order to provide a no computer use control for the experiment. Participants were instructed to select a condition based on their month of birth. When participants selected their birth month, the computer logic within SurveyGizmo assigned them to the appropriate group and the appropriate instruction was provided. 
    Facebook = January, April, July or October
    Online = February, May, August or November
    Control = March, June, September or December
    
¥ Gender: The gender of the participant that was given in response to the question. 
    Male
    Female
    
¥ Age: Age range of the participant that was given in response to the question. 
    A = 18-24 years old
    B = 25-35 years old
    C = 36-50 years old
    D = 51-65 years old
    E = 66 years or older
    
¥ TimeValue: How participants felt about time spent on Facebook.
    A = Time spent on Facebook is a good use of time
    B = Time spent on Facebook is wasted time
    C = Don’t know
    
¥ FBTime: How much time participants reported that that they spent on Facebook each week.
    A = Less than 1 hour per week
    B = Between 1 and 5 hours per week
    C = Between 5 and 10 hours per week
    D = Between 10 and 20 hours per week
    E = More than 20 hours per week

Note: The last three variables were not used in the results and analysis of our experiment. We had originally intended to include this data, but when our hypothesis was not confirmed, we did not continue with analysis of these items.
